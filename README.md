# Annotation
I recently started working on annotating the genome of an Opossum sample we have. I am still learning which is the correct step by step to use for this, and I have also been using this pipeline (https://github.com/KrabbenhoftLab/genome_annotation_pipeline). However, in parallel, I am trying to run some steps that I will upload here.
