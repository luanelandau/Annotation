# Annotation
I recently started working on annotating the genome of an Opossum sample we have. I am still learning which is the correct step by step to use for this, and I have also been using this pipeline (https://github.com/KrabbenhoftLab/genome_annotation_pipeline). However, in parallel, I am trying to run some steps that I will upload here.

Before doing the annotation using RNA-seq data, one needs to trim the RNA, and control for quality. Therefore, this tool called https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore uses cutadapt and fastqc to do this, and can easily be installed using conda environments. Therefore, I am currently working on that and will upload the scripts for this here.
